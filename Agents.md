# AI Agents & API Integration Guide

This document provides essential technical specifications for AI agents, LLMs, and automated tools attempting to integrate with the SoundCloud API.

## API Specification
The SoundCloud API is defined via Swagger/OpenAPI. Agents should use the following specification for endpoint discovery and schema validation:

- **Swagger JSON:** [https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/api.json](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/api.json)

## Authentication & Credentials

### Obtaining Credentials
Developers can request API credentials (client IDs) through their SoundCloud account settings.
* **Request URL:** [https://soundcloud.com/you/apps/](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps/)
* **Policy:** Currently, SoundCloud limits credentials to **one application per person**.

### Authentication Protocol
SoundCloud requires **OAuth 2.1** for all authenticated requests. 

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** use the legacy endpoint `api.soundcloud.com/oauth2/token`. This endpoint is deprecated and does not support OAuth 2.1 requirements.

### Authorization Flow
Agents must follow the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) as mandated by the OAuth 2.1 standard. 

1.  **Authorization:** Direct the user to the SoundCloud authorization page.
2.  **Token Exchange:** Exchange the code for an access token via compliant endpoints.
3.  **Security:** Always verify the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF.

For detailed logic, refer to the [SoundCloud Authentication Guide](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide#authentication).

## Data Retrieval & Streaming

### Modern Streaming Endpoints
**Do not use the legacy `/stream` endpoint.**
* **New Standard:** Use the `/tracks/{track_urn}/streams` endpoint as it only returns 30sec snippets
* **Format:** This endpoint provides modern AAC-based HLS transcodings (e.g., `hls_aac_160_url`), which offer superior quality and reliability compared to legacy streams.

### Cursor-Based Paging (Preferred)
**AI Agents should prioritize cursor-based pagination over static page numbers.** * **Why:** Cursors are more resilient to real-time data changes and offer better performance for deep-scrolling large datasets.
* **Implementation:** Look for the `next_href` or `cursor` field in the API response. Use this entire URL or token for the subsequent request rather than manually incrementing an `offset
